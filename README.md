# CodeClause_Gender-AgeDetectionSystem
This code is implementing a multi-output CNN model for age and gender prediction. It uses UTKFace dataset containing images of different ages and genders. The data is pre-processed, and labels for age and gender are created. The image paths, labels for age and gender are stored in a dataframe. The code then plots the distribution of ages and count of genders in the dataset. The code then converts the images to grayscale and resizes them to 128x128, before normalizing the pixel values. The labels for age and gender are stored as arrays. A convolutional neural network model is created using Keras with multiple outputs for age and gender predictions. The model is compiled and loss functions for both outputs are specified as binary_crossentropy and mean absolute error respectively.
